# High Level Roadmap

Armadillo tries to balance simplicity and ease-of-use with *enough* features and extensibility. With that in mind, here is the high level roadmap for development.

# Ongoing Updates
Improvements to be made sometime before or for version 2.0

- be able to set certain file extensions to open with Armadillo (if already open, use existing process)
- Create a .deb package and make available through apt
- Spellcheck plugin
- Help plugin (with quick search tools tied to langauge)
- Be able to install with pip
- Native Mac binaries
- syntax checking option for Scintilla/Python would be nice.

# Armadillo 2.0
- Easily install and update plugins via a plugin manager
- Continuous checking if open files have changed and alert user (a manual check exists from main menu)
- Better autocomplete functionality (maybe - if feature does not become to heavy)
- Python 3 support
- An update mechanism for Armadillo

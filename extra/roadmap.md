# High Level Roadmap

## Current State
**Armadillo 1.0 has been released with Windows binaries (no installation required)**

## Armadillo 1.2
Soon to be released. See the dev branch for current state. Ui was cleaned up with less customization of plugin location, but better screen utilization. Lots of new features.

## Armadillo 1.3
Wish list yet to be determined.

## Armadillo 2.0
Armadillo 2.0 will allow for better plugin use - updates and installing new ones.

- [ ] Ease of use of adding plugins
- [ ] Ease of use for users creating and adding their own plugins
- [ ] Continous checking and alert if open files have changed outside of editor
- [ ] Maybe more autocomplete functionality - if not to *heavy*
- [ ] Python 3 support
- [ ] Handle updates of plugins
- [ ] Auto update Armadillo would be nice

## Additional Features
Features that can be added independent of version

- [ ] Spellcheck plugin
- [ ] syntax checking for Scintilla/Python would be nice.
- [ ] Native Mac binaries
- [ ] be able to set certain file extensions to open with Armadillo (if already open, use existing process)
- [ ] Create .deb package

Armadillo comes with standard plugins and will become extensible for additional plugins in the future.  All plugins are dockable widgets that can be moved around.  The plugin state is stored with each Workspace.  If a plugin is closed, you can bring it back by clicking the ![Alt Text](../img/plugin.png) plugin button or through the main menu.

## Standard Plugins
- **File Browser** - Browse your workspace directory
- **Find/Replace** - Common find/replace functions
- **Outline** - Outline of code structure
- **Output** - Displays output of running file (only works for Python)
- **PyQt Converter** - Convert Qt Designer ui files to python
- **Python Shell** - An interactive Python shell

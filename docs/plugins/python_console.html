<h1>Python Console</h1>

<p>The Python Console is a simple interactive Python interpreter with access to the Scope environment.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Unless you are running from Python source, the shell uses Python 2.7</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If you don&#39;t have Python 2.7 installed and are using the Windows binary, then you will have limited Python functions - only what is bundled with Scope.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Ctrl +L - will launch the shell outside of Scope with your default Python install (Python and PyQt must be installed).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>You can access Scope from the shell with the <em>scope</em> object. <strong>Be careful as you can lose work</strong>.</p>

	<pre>
<code>  scope.currentWidget() # Gets the current editor widget
  scope.currentWidget().getText() # Gets the text from the current editor widget
</code></pre>
	</li>
</ul>

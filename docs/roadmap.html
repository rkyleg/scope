<h1>Scope Roadmap</h1>

This roadmap contains details on where Scope is headed. Scope is currently considered in beta state (version 0.3.x).

<h2>Philosophy</h2>

When adding features, Scope will attempt to adhere to the following ideals

<ul>
	<li><strong>lightweight</strong>&nbsp;- keep lightweight and don&#39;t have a lot of features running for every edit</li>
	<li><strong>clean interface</strong>&nbsp;- don&#39;t clutter main interface with lots of buttons</li>
	<li><strong>utilize screenspace</strong>&nbsp;- make sure Scope works well on small screens (and large)</li>
	<li><strong>cross platform</strong>&nbsp;- must work on Windows, Linux, and Mac</li>
</ul>

<h2>Near term features planned</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Create a settings interface to replace current config file</li>
	<li>Create a plugin manager interface that will allow installing plugins from a web link or a zip file</li>
	<li>Move out some of the extra plugins from the main source</li>
	<li>Lock down API - stop making changes and have a good API for creating plugins</li>
	<li>Code Cleanup - with lots of redesigns, the code can be improved</li>
	<li>Good documentation on using and creating plugins</li>
</ul>

<h2>Longer term features planned</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Create binaries for Mac and Linux</li>
	<li>Plugin update mechanism</li>
	<li>Plugin dependency and version tracking</li>
	<li>Help plugin</li>
	<li>Better autocomplete for Python</li>
	<li>Python 3 code base</li>
</ul>

<h2>Python 3 Support</h2>
Scope can only be run from source with Python 2. Sometime in 2016-2018, Scope will convert to Python 3. Due to limited development time, Scope will just convert to Python 3 and likely not support both. Around the same time, Scope will also convert from Qt 4.8 to Qt 5.latest.

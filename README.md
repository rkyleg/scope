About
==
I didn't really want to create a new IDE and yet I wanted to create a new IDE.  afide is inspired by SPE, Geany, Notepad++ and Spyder.  afide is written in Python with PyQt and HTML5 for the UI.  HTML5 is utilized with Qt's built in WebKit (WebView).

The goals of afide:
- Cross Platform (Linux, Windows, and maybe Mac)
- Handle Multiple languages (Python, Javascript, HTML, etc.)
- Easily create plugins with PyQt
- Be able to utilize existing code editors (CkEditor, Ace, Scintilla, etc.)
- Customizable and easily extensible

Requirements
==
afide is not yet compiled so you must run it with Python.  I have only tested it on Linux (Mint 15) so far.
- Python 2.6-2.7 (Not tested with 3.x or 2.6 although 2.6 should work)
- PyQt 4.8 (Not tested with 5.x)
- Python-Qsci
- Python-YAML

Settings
==
Settings are stored in settings.yaml

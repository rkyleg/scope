About
==
I didn't really want to create a new IDE and yet I wanted to create a new IDE.  The goals of afide:
- Cross Platform (Windows/Linux and maybe Max)
- Handle Multiple languages (Python, Javascript, HTML, etc.)
- Easily create plugins with PyQt
- Be able to utilize existing code editors (CkEditor, Ace, Scintilla, etc.)
- Customizable and easily extensible
